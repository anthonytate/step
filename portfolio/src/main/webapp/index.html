      <h1>Anthony's Super Amazing Portfolio</h1>
      <p>
         Welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Anthony Dewayne Tate and I'm
         from San Leandro, CA, in the Bay Area. My favorite subject to learn 
         about is biology, but my favorite subject to do work with is computer 
         science. I love to run (and exercise in general), eat, and hang out 
         with friends and family. My favorite artist is J. Cole and Kendrick 
         Lamar is second.
